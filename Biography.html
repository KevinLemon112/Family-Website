<center> Biography and Descriptions of my Dad. </center>
<br>

I would describe my dad as:
<ol>

<li>Brave</li>

<li>Strong</li>

<li>Caring</li>

<li>Supportive</li>

<li>Incredible</li>

<li>And a Role Model</li>

</ol>

My dad has always been someone you can count on if ever needed. If you ever needed help with something, he was the one 
who could help you the best. My dad has always been a hard worker, even if times are at the worst they could possibly be,
my dad would pull through it as if it was nothing. My dad has always had a hard life because the economy in Iran, Tehran
was never good and it was very hard to make money during those times. The government was also very corrupt, with everyone
looking for as much money and power they could come up with to stay at the top.

My dad has always had a passion for cars. He would work as a mechanic in his home country and he still is a mechanic even to this day.
My dad would have to work for anything he wanted back in the day because back them money was extremely tight for him and he would have to 
work three months during the summer just to buy a pair of shoes. My dad has a highschool education but could not go any farther in his education 
because in Iran, once you turn seventeen they require you to go to the army for twenty four months. All in all, my dad has had a very hard life up to this
point but he managed to pull through to result in a better life in the end.
