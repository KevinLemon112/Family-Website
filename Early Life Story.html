This is one especially important early life story about my dad. One time, when my parents were only boyfriend and girlfriend, my mom was out with her 
friend when she saw my dad with his friend on the motorcycle of his friend. Then, my dad told my mom that he wanted to go out with his friend on his motorcycle.
My mom then told my dad to not go with him and to go with her to hangout. My dad listened and came off the motorcycle to jon her. My mom felt confused, because she did not expect for him to leave his friend to join her.
My dad's friend then drove off with his motorcycle alone after my dad left him. Five minutes later my parents heard that my dad's friends had a accident, and was pronounced dead. This was crazy because I cannot imagine what 
would have happened to my dad if he stayed on the motorcycle with his friend. It feels like god had my dad's back at that moment and saved his life from what could have been a tragic story for him.
